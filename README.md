# nandflash
A tool to help those who want to flash the WIFI module but dont know DOS

This is a self extracting WINRAR archive, it will install the files into
user folder > flash
it will also create a short cut on the desktop
TO USE IS SIMPLE

ensure the TTL board is connected and you have wired up the WIFI board
correctly

Run the program and just click the button to start the process.
The only intervention needed is to enter the com port that is being
used, if you arent sure then run Device Manager and look under Ports
to see which one is in use by TTL adaoptor.

The program will run the first flash, then exit after 20 seconds
It will then run the flash again until it completes
